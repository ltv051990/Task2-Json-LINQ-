C# .NET Project

"You need to write a console application that would read from the disk a json file containing two arrays of numbers and output the following aggregated information:
- unique numbers (among all the set of numbers found in both arrays)
- unique odd numbers from the first array and information how many times such a number occurs in the second array
- the sum of even numbers of the first array, which are not represented in the second array"
